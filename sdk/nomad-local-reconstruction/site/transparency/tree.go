// Package transparency is the distribution half of publisher identity.
//
// The chain in the parent package makes rollback and equivocation *detectable
// by a reader who sees both branches*. It does not make anyone see both
// branches. A reader who has been shown only the attacker's descriptor accepts
// it, indefinitely, and nothing in the chain bounds how long that lasts. That
// gap is what this package closes.
//
// Descriptors are appended to a public log. A reader accepts a descriptor only
// with an inclusion proof against a signed checkpoint it holds, and only while
// that checkpoint is fresh. Three properties follow, and each answers a
// different attack:
//
//   - **Inclusion.** A descriptor the attacker showed only to one reader is
//     not in the log, so it has no proof, so it is not accepted. To be
//     accepted it must be published where the real site owner can see it --
//     which is what makes a recovery possible at all.
//   - **Consistency.** A log cannot rewrite its own history: every new
//     checkpoint must be consistent with the last one the reader verified.
//     This is rollback resistance at the distribution layer, mirroring the
//     chain's at the identity layer.
//   - **Freshness.** A reader that has not obtained a new checkpoint within
//     its window stops treating publications as identity-verified, so a split
//     view costs the attacker a window rather than forever.
//
// The hashing is RFC 6962's: a leaf is H(0x00 || entry) and an interior node
// is H(0x01 || left || right). The prefixes are the whole reason the structure
// is safe -- without them a leaf could be presented as an interior node and a
// proof could be forged.
//
// What this does not do: it does not make the log honest. A log that signs two
// checkpoints of the same size with different roots has equivocated, and this
// package produces the proof rather than preventing it. Preventing it needs
// more than one log, or witnesses, which is a deployment decision recorded in
// the specification.
