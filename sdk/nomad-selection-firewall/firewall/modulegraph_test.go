// A vulnerability gate scans what is there and a digest pins what is there;
// neither says anything about a module arriving. This does.
//
// It is worth asserting rather than noticing because the current answer is
// zero. A module graph at zero is a claim a reader checks in one line; one at
// four is a list somebody has to keep reviewing, and the difference between
// them should be a decision rather than a diff nobody read.

// thirdPartyModules is the scan itself, factored out so the control below runs
// this code rather than a second copy of it. `go list -m all` prints the main
// module first; everything after it is a dependency.
